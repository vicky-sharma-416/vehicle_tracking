Must haves - 

1. Explain what and why the technologies you recommend should be used ? 
VS :- Should use Node.js along with socket communication because of ASYNC and single thread system for backend, also can use Python for the same too.
      For Front-end should use React.js because of virtual DOM facilites which render page only require, also can use Angular for the same too. 

2. Deployment strategies. (Bonus point for a production setup diagram) ?
VS :- We can have bitbucket for Deployment and every developer can create new barnch from DEV fork and once tested will create PR for QA / staging once deployment done then after final testing can create PR for PROD;  

3. What kind of tests could be integrated in the CI/CD pipeline ?
VS :- Deployment will consist of unit test for backend and automation testing for front-end(it will test UI functionality like after click on button dashboard appear or not etc.).
